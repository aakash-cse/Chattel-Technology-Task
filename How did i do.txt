Hi there,
here i have converted the .ipynb to .py 
of the repository on github
along with that i had done the training in google colab
and downloaded the .pkl file and set up the environment(flask)
and installed the dependencies for the folder and ran app.py and 
ran the request.py which helps me to get the results which is included in the 
zip file
